About this Project
------------------
This project was completed on 4 June 2016 as the sixth coding project in the COEN 12 Abstract Data Types and Data Structures course at Santa Clara University. “deque.cpp” and “deque.h” were written by Ray Che, building off of the included source files provided by Professor Darren C. Atkinson of the Computer Science and Engineering department. This project contains two parts: a computer-controlled maze program as well as a radix sort program. The former utilizes deque.cpp to generate a maze and find its way through the maze. The latter takes in a series of numerical inputs from the user and sorts it using radix sorting. This source code is only to be used as an example of Ray Che's programming ability as of the completion of the 2015-2016 academic year and shall not be used to assist other students attempting to complete the same project at Santa Clara University. Using this project in the latter manner is academic dishonesty and a violation of the student conduct code.
